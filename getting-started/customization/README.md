# Customization

Most applications will find the default installation for Socialstream sufficient for adding the benefit of Socialite OAuth integration into their next Laravel project. However, if you wish to customize certain elements, Socialstream makes this super easy for you by publishing a number of "actions" that you can change to suit your needs.

This section will detail all the ways you can customize Socialstream to get the most out of the package:

* [Socialite Redirect](socialite-redirect.md)
* [Resolving Users](resolving-users.md)
* [Handling the `InvalidStateException`](handling-invalid-state.md)
* [Handling OAuth Callback Errors](handling-oauth-errors.md)
* [Authenticating Users](authenticating-users.md)
