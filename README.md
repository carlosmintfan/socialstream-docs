# Release Notes

## Versioning Scheme

Socialstream follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). We try to keep breaking changes to a minimum. However, major releases may contain breaking change, or in some circumstance, rewrite entire parts of the packages inner-workings. Miner and patch releases should **never** contain breaking changes.

## PHP

Socialstream follows the minimum required Laravel PHP version. At its release, Socialstream 5.x requires a minimum PHP version of 8.1.
