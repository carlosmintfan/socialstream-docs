Socialstream combines the beautify of [Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/2.x/introduction.html) with the simplicty of [Laravel Socialite](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/socialite) to give developers a convenient way to integrate authentication with OAuth providers.

Because Socialstream relies on Laravel Socialite, it currently only supports the providers Socialite support. These are: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google, GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
